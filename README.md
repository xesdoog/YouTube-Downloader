# YouTube-Downloader
Simple python script that downloads YouTube videos.
The UI is very ugly. This script was an exercise for me to learn about Tkinter.

> [!NOTE]
> If you provide a playlist link, the script will only download the first video. Maybe I will add an option to download the whole playlist idk at the moment this was simply an exercise.

### For Users:

If you know how to setup requirements and stuff, feel free to use the script as it is. If not, a portable executable will be provided soon.
